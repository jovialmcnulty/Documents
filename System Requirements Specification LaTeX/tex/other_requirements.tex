As realistically, the robotic arm will be re-purposed at conclusion of the senior design project. It is important that the team considers the modularity of the system so that all components can easily be detached/re-attached with minimal effort. This is important as the customer may want to use the components in this product for other projects yet retain the ability to take the polished project to showcases and other demonstration events where quality of presentation is critical.



%Include a header paragraph specific to your product here. In this section specify anything else that is required for the product to be deemed complete. Include requirements related to customer setup and configuration if not specified in a previous requirement. Add any known requirements related to product architecture/design, such as modularity, extensibility (for future enhancements), or adaptation for a specific programming language. Consider requirements such as portability of your source code to various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix Mac OS, etc.).
