The main lab space to be used during the UR5 Jenga Playing Robot will be the Senior Design laboratory in the Engineering Research Building Room 208. We will use this space for accessing the UR5 robotic arm, 3D printing of components, and development and implementation of electronic components that will be programmed. 

Some specific equipment that will be used is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{UR5 Robotic Arm}: Leased from the College of Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington
    \item \textbf{3D printers}: Such as UltiMaker2, FormLabs Form 2, and IIIP. Available for use at the Senior Design lab maker space
    \item \textbf{Laser cutter}: Available for use at the Senior Design lab maker space or the UT Arlington FabLab maker space
    \item \textbf{Soldiering equipment}: Available for use at the Senior Design lab maker space
    \item \textbf{Design software}:  For chip development, 3D printing. Available for use at the Senior Design lab maker space
\end{itemize}

Other spaces that may be used include the University of Texas at Arlington Library FabLab, which provides access to a workshop, laser cutter, and 3D printers.
