Upon completion of the computer vision aspect of our Jenga-playing robot prototype, we expect the following milestones to be met:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Ability to scan the collapsed playing field (unordered scattered blocks) in order to find the initial locations and orientations of the game pieces
  \item Ability to scan the vertical playing field and find changes between turns to create a map that will be used to determine the robot's next block pull
  \item Ability to recognize when the game has ended (blocks have collapsed)
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Upon completion of the UR-5 robotic gripper system, we expect the following milestones to be met:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ability to grab and remove a block from any location in the vertical game field
    \item Ability to move and place a block into a c position
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Upon completion of the completed 3D-Vision and gripper systems, we expect the following milestones to be met:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Ability to algorithmically take blocks from the collapsed playing field and create the initial stacked game state
  \item A play time of less than 60 seconds per turn, which includes finding the most suitable block to remove using a custom game-play engine, removing the block, and stacking it on the top of the game field
\end{itemize}
