The growing need for scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians has led to much research on fostering interests in STEM at an early age. It has been shown \cite{McClure2017} that engaging younger students with demonstrations of science and technology correlates with future interest and success in STEM. Considering this increasing need and the recent decline in interest \cite{Sadler2012}, developing a playful demonstration targeted at younger audiences can help spurt new growth. This project serves as an interactive demonstration of computer science concepts with the goal of inspiring the next generation of scientists \& engineers.

%The Robot Jenga Player's vision is to show impressionable youth what they can achieve by pursuing an engineering degree. Displaying this project at different outreach and trade show events can give future engineers the ability to learn about, and use, the Jenga player. By showing them something enjoyable and interesting that can be achieved through an engineering degree, it may in turn spark an engineering curiosity that some of today's youth have.
