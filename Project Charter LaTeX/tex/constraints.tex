The following list contains key constraints related to the implementation and testing of the project.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Final prototype demonstration must be completed by May 2019.
  \item The UR5 robot arm is currently being used by another Senior Design team, so we will have to share access to the arm.
  \item Total development costs, including purchasing cameras and grippers, must not exceed our budget of \$800 and support from sponsors.
  \item Since our project is meant to be used for demonstrations at trade shows, we may not be able to rely on consistent lighting conditions.
  \item The product must be easy to set up and interaction must be natural enough to be able to be demonstrated at trade shows.
\end{itemize}
