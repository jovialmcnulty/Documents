The objective of this project is to implement a Jenga-playing robot system involving a human opponent. Our solution will utilize 3D computer vision to develop scans of the tower's state, and a vacuum gripper to grip blocks. The human opponent will take turns with the robot performing block pulls and placing them at the top of the stack. The goal isn't necessarily to defeat the human opponent, but build a system capable of make multiple moves prior to the tower collapsing.
